The code is assigning values to two variables, 
`SHOPIFY_HOSTNAME` and `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`. 
The value assigned to 
`SHOPIFY_HOSTNAME` is `'HOST_SHOPIFY'` 
and the value assigned to 
`SHOPIFY_API_KEY` is `'API_KEY_SHOPIFY'`. 
These variables are likely used to store the hostname 
and API key for a Shopify integration or API connection.

SHOPIFY_HOSTNAME='HOST_SHOPIFY'
SHOPIFY_API_KEY='API_KEY_SHOPIFY'
